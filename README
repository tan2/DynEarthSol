DynEarthSol3D is a finite element code that solves the momentum balance and 
the heat transfer in Lagrangian form using unstructured meshes. It can be
used to study the long-term deformation of Earth's lithosphere and problems
alike.


===========
Build
===========

Requirement:
* You will need a recent C++ compiler that supports C++11 standard. (GNU g++
  4.4 or newer version will suffice.)
* You will need a recent version of Boost::Program_options library (1.42 or
  newer version). Instructions for building the library:
  -- Download the source code from www.boost.org
  -- In the untarred source directory, run "./bootstrap.sh"
  -- In the same directory, run "./b2 --with-program_options -q" to build
     the library.
* You will need Python 2.6+ or 3.2+ and the Numpy package.

Build procedure:
* Edit 'Makefile', modify BOOST_ROOT_DIR if you manually built or installed 
  boost library. If you followed the instructions above to build 
  Boost::Program_options library, set BOOST_ROOT_DIR to the untarred boost
  directory.
* Run "make" to build an optimized 2D executable 'dynearthsol2d'.
* Run "make ndims=3" to build an optimized 3D executable 'dynearthsol3d'.
* Run "make opt=0" to build a debugging executable.
* Run "make openmp=0" to build the executable without OpenMP. This is
  necessary to debug the code under valgrind.


===========
Run
===========

* Execute "dynearthsol2d inputfile".
* Several example input files are provided under 'examples/' directory. The
  format of the input file is described in 'examples/defaults.cfg'.
* Benchmark cases with analytical solution can be found under 'benchmarks/'
  directory.
* Execute the executable with '-h' flag to see the available input parameters
  and their descriptions.


===========
Plot
===========

* Run "2vtk.py modelname" to convert the binary output to VTK files.
* Execute 2vtk.py with '-h' flag to see more usage information.
* Some of the simulation outputs might be disabled. Edit 2vtk.py and
  output.cxx to disable/enable them.
* Plot the VTK files with Paraview or LLNL's Visit program.
